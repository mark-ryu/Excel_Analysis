    "Commonly, you use a value of 0.05 (or 5%) as the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. So in this case, the p-value is much lower than this threshold and we can reject the hypothesis that the increase in values can be explained by random variance and conclude that there is some nonrandom factor at work here. Note that we can’t categorically say that the increase in values is because of the higher number of a variable.\n",

    "It’s worth briefly thinking a little bit about what this means. What does this show? We have shown that, had the results been due to chance (i.e., H0 = true), we could possibly still get these results. In other words, we haven’t disproven chance as an explanation. However, we showed that the probability of getting these results is very, very, very small…only 0.0000000000000000003. We are safe in rejecting chance as an explanation for our results here. "

The example above is a 1-sample test (it tests a single sample of data to compare the sample mean with a hypothesized mean). The example is also a 1-tailed test, and in this case, the test is right-tailed (our p-value describes the probability of a sample mean being significantly higher than the hypothesized mean, which means the critical area for rejection of the null hypothesis is under the right tail of a normal distribution curve. \n",

To perform 2-tailed tests in Excel, you need to manipulate the value retuned by the Z.TEST function to calculate the correct p-value as follows: \n",
